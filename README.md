# Shorthand HEX Color Converter (JS vs. TS)

This repository provides documentation and sample code for converting 3-digit shorthand HEX color codes (e.g., `#f0c`) to their 6-digit full form (e.g., `#ff00cc`).

The main purpose is to explain the key differences in implementation between JavaScript and TypeScript, particularly why a simple JavaScript function can cause type-safety errors in a strict TypeScript environment.
